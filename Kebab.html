<h1><em>Ingredients</em></h1>
<li>1 medium yellow onion, quartered</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves</li>
<li>1 whole bunch parsley, stems removed (about 2 packed cups parsley leaves)</li>
<li>1 lb ground beef</li>
<li>1/2 lb ground lamb</li>
<li>1 slice of bread, toasted until browned and soaked in water until fully tender</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>1 1/2 tsp ground allspice</li>
<li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1/2 tsp ground green cardamom</li>
<li>1/2 tsp ground sumac</li>
<li>/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
<li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
<li>Pita bread to serve</li>
<h3>For the Fixings:</h3>
<li>Tahini Sauce</li>
<li>Tomato wedges</li>
<li>Onion wedges</li>
<li>More parsley</li>


<h1><em>Instructions</em></h1>
<ol>

<li>Soak 10 wooden skewers in water for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from water when you are ready to begin. Lightly oil the grates of a gas grill and preheat it to medium-high for about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Prepare pita bread and fixings. If you plan to, make the tahini sauce from this recipe. Prepare other sides and salads before you begin grilling.</li> 
<li>In a food processor, chop the onion, garlic, and parsley.</li>
<li>Add the beef, lamb, bread (be sure to squeeze out the water completely), and the spices. Run the processor until all is well combined forming a pasty meat mixture.</li>
<li>Remove the meat mixture from the food processor and place in a large bowl. Take a fistful portion of the meat mixture and mold it on a wooden skewer. Repeat the process until you have run out of meat. For best results, make sure each kofta kebab is about 1 inch in thickness.</li>
<li>Lay the skewered kofta kebabs on a tray lined with parchment paper</li>
<li>Place the kofta kebabs on the lightly oiled, heated gas grill. Grill on medium-high heat for 4 minutes on one side, turn over and grill for another 3-4 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve the kofta kebabs immediately with pita bread, tahini and the fixings you prepared. See suggestions for sides and related recipes.</li>
